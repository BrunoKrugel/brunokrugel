# About me

<p align="justify">

Hi, I'm Bruno, commonly known as `BK`, a dedicated software developer with a diverse journey.

My background as an *Electronic Technician* and extensive experience with customer support have contributed to my becoming a versatile full-stack developer.

In 2016, I started my career at a local ERP company. After some time working as a developer, I realized that I had a lack of customer interaction skills. Then I started working at SAP, assuming the role of a *Customer Technical Support Specialist*.

During two years, I improved my soft skills in addressing customer needs. In 2019, I returned to the software development scenario as a *Full-stack Developer*.

Currently, I work as a *Senior Backend Developer*, primarily with microservices. My proficiency in this domain and my customer-centric approach empower me to craft efficient and effective solutions.

If you have any questions regarding my career, feel free to check my [resume](https://github.com/BrunoKrugel/resume/blob/main/pdfresume_en.pdf).
