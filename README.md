# About me

<p align="justify">
Hi, my name is Bruno, but you can call me BK, I gratuated as Electronic Technician in 2015, but started my career in 2016 as a Full-stack Developer in an ERP company and after some experience in the area, I realized that I had a lack of experience in understanding customers needs, so, I decided it was time for new challenges and started working at SAP as a Customer Technical support and after two years improving my soft skills, I returned to development in 2019 and I have been working as a Backend Developer working with micro services since 2019.
